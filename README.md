# U.S-Capital-Game

## Overveiw 

### This JavaScript code is meant to serve as a dual purpose focused on U.S. States and captial for interactive and algorithmic programming tasks. 

In the first part, it begins by presenting an array containing pairs of states and their corresponding capitals. The code then performs a bubble sort based on the alphabetical order of the capitals. Subsequently, it prompts the user with a quiz, asking for the capitals of each state and tallying the correct responses.

Moving to the second part, the code constructs a HashMap using the states and capitals data. It displays the content of the HashMap and sorts it alphabetically. The user is then prompted to enter a state, and the code retrieves and displays the corresponding capital from the sorted HashMap.
